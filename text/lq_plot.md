# Location quotient plot breakdown

The plot above shows [location quotients](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/understandingtownsindustryanalysis/2021-12-13/previous/v1) for the selected region (with the option to compare to other regions). 

**Here's what you're looking at:**

* Location quotients for sectoral GVA in the selected region
* Sectors to the right of the blue line are **more concentrated in this region when compared to the national average.** (e.g. LQ = 10, it is 10x more concentrated)
* Green circles have been **increasing in concentration over time** (larger circles increasing the most)
* Red circles have been **decreasing in concentration over time** (larger circles decreasing the most)
* Black horizontal lines show the **min and max of concentration in the data's history** (from 2015 to 2023) (so, often, large green circles will be at the right of this line because sector concentration has been steadily increasing)
* Per sector GVA money amounts and percent of that region's entire economy are shown on the right.
